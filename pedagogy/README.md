#### 1. Focus Area : Reinforce theoretical concepts, and Data Analysis.
By this experiment we want students to understand the concept of mechanical energy balance existing in the fluid flows. By doing this experiment they would themselves analyze that if the value of one form of energy is reduced by any means then the value for other form increases. And this is always true for ideal fluid for different flow rates.

#### 2. Learning Objectives and Cognitive Level

<h5>Description:</h5>
Here we have identified three learning objectives. As both the experiments are based on the universal laws for the subjects therefore it includes remembering of the theorem and facts and then operation or execution the experiment. Further during the operation student will be able to understand the theorem and further based on the observations students will be able to to analyse and reach the outcome.

<h5>Method:</h5>
To achieve attainment of all the objectives the experiment is designed for different sets of flow rates so that students may learn through performing.

#### 3. Instructional Strategy
###### Name of Instructional Strategy  :    <u> Expository
###### Assessment Method: Submmative


<h5>DESCRIPTION:</h5>
Step by step instructions are provided at each level in the simulator to make it more user friendly.

<h5>SCOPE:</h5>
Various runs of the same experiment are possible at changing values of flow rates, so that user may completely learn the objectives.

Sr.No | What Students will do? |	What Simulator will do?	| Purpose of the task
:--|:--|:--|:--:
1.| Student will switch on the motor  | Click on the ‘motor button '  | To start the flow of water through the system.
2.| Student will regulate the flow of water <br> by rotating the valve | Click on the ‘outlet valve to rotate it '  | To adjust/set the flow rate of water.
3.| Student will measure the height in manometer<br>by collecting the water <br>in collecting tank  | Click on the ‘gate valve <br> to close it  '  | To measure the flow rate .
4.| Student will record  <br> all the respective heights and readings <br> shown by the simulator | Note down the readings  | to do calculations for verification of Bernoulli's theorum.
