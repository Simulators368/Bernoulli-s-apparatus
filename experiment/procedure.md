### Procedure

1. Start the motor by clicking on motor button.	
2. Open the outlet valve for water to flow through the duct and to prevent overflow of system.
3. Note down the piezometers distance from inlet section of the Perspex duct.
4. Note down the cross-sectional area of Perspex duct at each of the piezpmeter tapping points.
5. The datum head is treated as constant through out the duct.
6. The discharge flowing in the conduit is recorded together with the water levels in each piezometer tubes.
7. Now Close the gate valve for measuring flow rate.
8. See the stopwatch, collect water in the collecting tank for 30sec and note down the height in collecting tank.
9. Calculate the flow rate and then calculate further velocity head and total head.
10. Plot Pressure head vs (Piezometer distances from same reference point).
11. This procedure is repeated for other value of discharge.
