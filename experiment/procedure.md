### Procedure

1. Switch on the motor
2. once the Inlet tank, Perpex tube and outlet is filled then open the outlet valve once
3. Record the piezometers readings from inlet section of the Perspex duct.
4. Record the cross-sectional area of Perspex duct, at each of the piezometer tapping points.
5. The datum head is treated as constant through out the duct as the tube is horizontally placed.
6. Turn off the gate valve to fill the measuring tank.
7. Record the final height reached in measuring tank after 30 seconds.
8. Calculate the fow rate, velocity, Kinetic energy head and total energy head.
9. Plot the graph of Pressure energy head vs distance of perpex tube.
10. This procedure is repeated for other values of discharge.
