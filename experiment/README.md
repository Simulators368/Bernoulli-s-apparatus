### Aim
### To verify the Bernoulli’s theorem experimentally i.e. conservation of mechanical energy.
### Theory
### Bernoulli’s equation states that:
### “In an ideal, incompressible fluid flow when the flow is steady and continuous, the sum of pressure energy, kinetic energy and potential energy is constant along a stream line”.

### Mathematical Representation,
	 

	 

### Assumptions: It may be mentioned that the following assumptions are made in the derivation of Bernoulli’s equation.

### 1.	The liquid is ideal and incompressible.
### 2.	The flow is steady and continuous.
### 3.	The flow is along the streamline, i.e. it is one-dimensional.
### 4.	The velocity is uniform over the section and is equal to the mean velocity.
### 5.	The only forces acting on the fluid are the gravity forces and the pressure forces.

### Rate of flow or Actual Discharge (Q)=(Area of collecting tank X Rise of water level in the collecting tank)/(time t) 

### The water flowing through the section of a pipe or a channel under the steady state conditions is collected in a collecting tank for a known time t. The rise of water level in the collecting tank is noted down. The actual discharge is

	 

### Experimental set up:

### The experimental set up consists of a horizontal Perspex duct of smooth variable cross-section of convergent and divergent type. The section is 40 mm x 40 mm at the entrance and exit and 40 mm x 20 mm at middle. The total length of duct is 900 mm. The piezometric pressure P at the locations of pressure tapping is measured by means of 11 piezometer tubes installed at an equal distance 75 mm along the length of conduit. The duct is connected with supply tanks at its entrance and exit end with means of varying the flow rate. A collecting tank is used to find the actual discharge.
