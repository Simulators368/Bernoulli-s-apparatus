### Aim:
### To verify the Bernoulli’s theorem experimentally i.e. conservation of mechanical energy.
### Theory
### Bernoulli’s equation states that:
### “In an ideal, incompressible fluid flow when the flow is steady and continuous, the sum of pressure energy, kinetic energy and potential energy is constant along a stream line”.

### Mathematical Representation,
	 

	 

### Assumptions: It may be mentioned that the following assumptions are made in the derivation of Bernoulli’s equation.

### 1.	The liquid is ideal and incompressible.
### 2.	The flow is steady and continuous.
### 3.	The flow is along the streamline, i.e. it is one-dimensional.
### 4.	The velocity is uniform over the section and is equal to the mean velocity.
### 5.	The only forces acting on the fluid are the gravity forces and the pressure forces.

### Rate of flow or Actual Discharge (Q)=(Area of collecting tank X Rise of water level in the collecting tank)/(time t) 

### The water flowing through the section of a pipe or a channel under the steady state conditions is collected in a collecting tank for a known time t. The rise of water level in the collecting tank is noted down. The actual discharge is

	 

### Experimental set up:

### The experimental set up consists of the components that are mostly made up of transparent material like acrylic or glass. The set-up consists of a cylindrical inlet tank and an outlet tank to minimize the fluctuations in the flow mounted vertically on a stand. The inlet tank is connected with a Perspex duct of cross-sectional area of 16.0cm2. This Perspex duct ends connecting to the outlet tank with a cross-sectional area of 16.0cm2. The Perspex duct is also connected with eleven piezometers at its various cross sectional areas of 14.4cm2, 13.2 cm2, 12.0cm2, 10.8cm2, 9.2cm2, 8.0cm2, 9.2cm2, 10.8cm2, 12.0cm2, 13.2 cm2 and 14.4cm2 respectively, which are 7.5 cm apart from each other and also from inlet and outlet. At the outlet tank a valve is fitted to regulate the flow rate of water inside the conduit. This valve is followed by a pipe which carries outlet water to the measuring tank of cross sectional area of 1600cm2. A gate valve is again fitted at the outlet of the measuring tank which opens in reservoir. And measuring tank is also fitted with a tube which measures the height of water in measuring tank after closing the gate valve, at a prescribed time of 30 secs. 

### Procedure:
### 1.	Switch on the motor
### 2.  once the Inlet tank, Perpex tube and outlet is filled then open the outlet valve once
### 3. 	Record the piezometers readings from inlet section of the Perspex duct.
### 4.	Record the cross-sectional area of Perspex duct, at each of the piezometer tapping points.
### 5.	The datum head is treated as constant through out the duct as the tube is horizontally placed.
### 6.	Turn off the gate valve to fill the measuring tank.
### 7.  Record the final height reached in measuring tank after 30 seconds.
### 8.	Calculate the fow rate, velocity, Kinetic energy head and total energy head.
### 9.  Plot the graph of Kinetic energy head vs distance of perpex tube
### 10.  Plot the graph of Total energy head vs distance of perpex tube
### 11.	This procedure is repeated for other values of discharge.
